# Processing 3

Taken with Prof. Michael Penta at NECC.


Processing 3.1 is a language based on JAVA that is used for Intro To Computer Science at NECC. 
This was my first coding class and I was taught: X/Y Coords, Primitive Commands, Loops, Objects, Arrays,
If/Else Statements, and Custom/Built in Functions.


LAB 11

This was my final project where I was given the daunting task using everything I had learned 
during the semester to to write a program that was "cool" -seriously, there were 10 bonus points
if the program did something interesting or cool.

I used the entire length of the animated movie Aladdin on a compressed reel and ran it on a loop to see 
if the class could guess what they were watching. I also added a feature to help them that would pause the 
reel when the mouse button was held down. At the bottom of the screen I used arrays of star shaped objects 
that appeared at random and left a trail across the screen, of the color of the outfits, worn by the three 
main characters (yes it was deemed "cool" and I got the bonus points for a total score of 110/110).


LAB 8

Learning to draw and animate a program was not easy for me to learn so I was particularly proud of my
Beach scene that utilized a loop of seashells, trigonometry to create my off center umbrella, and sectors
mapped off so that the mouse functioning in the top half would use a custom function to alternate drawing birds
and clouds while the bottom sector if clicked would create starfish and beach pails over my predrawn palette.
